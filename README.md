# Classification-Neural-Network-Project
#By: James Perdue

#PREFACE
#This project was for my Algorithm Analysis class at Kennesaw State University
#The required hardware to run this project is jupyter notebook and python 3.6 or lower (to be compatible with tensorflow)
#Libraries included are matplotlib, numpy, and tensorflow v2 which includes Keras
#I suggest using anaconda to install of these items
#The data set used was the cifar10 dataset, which is cited below
#https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html(Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.)

#GOALS
#This project's main goal was to classify the defined categories of the cifar10 dataset using a trained model
#The accuracy that was achieved was around 50%, which is not great and not terrible
#Some ways to improve the accuracy of this project is to add more layers to the model, make the pictures grayscale, or find other options that I am unaware of

#THANKS FOR VIEWING MY PROJECT
